== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I display the trails on the front end of my site? =
The shortcode `[trail-manager]` can be used on any page or post to list out all the trail networks and trails. You can also specify a post-id to show only a specific trail network. There is a shortcode generator on the sidebar when editing a trail network that is helpful for this.
